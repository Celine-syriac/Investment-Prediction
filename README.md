## Investor-Consumer Behavior Forecasting with Classification Models

### Overview
This repository details the development of classification models to forecast investor-consumer behavior. The project involved organizing the development process, data cleaning, data preparation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Several classification models were trained, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The analysis demonstrated that the Decision Tree model outperformed the others, achieving an impressive F1 score of 60%.
